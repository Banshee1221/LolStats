                <h4 style="margin-top: 30px;margin-bottom:-10px;">The Topic</h4>

                <p><br/>
                    League of Legends is a multiplayer online battle arena style game. After its release from beta
                    in 2009, it quickly became the most played game in the world (by number of repeat users). The game
                    is extremely intricate and involves (on Summoner’s Rift, the specific game map targeted in this
                    project) a 5 versus 5 team battle where the aim of the game is to destroy the other teams nexus, or
                    base, before they destroy yours.<br/><br/>
                    The reason this game is so closely followed is because of the intense amount of information that can
                    take place within one game as well as all of the different combinations of items, champions and
                    various other elements that players choose per match. This amount of information makes League
                    a perfect candidate for visualizations, which if utilized to the right degree can allow an
                    individual to inspect certain key aspects of their game, in order to improve from the ground up as
                    well as just highlighting any key interests they may have on certain areas of their game as a whole.
                </p>
                <h4 style="margin-top: 30px;margin-bottom:-10px;">The Problem</h4>

                <p><br/>
                    Currently the statistics, if visualized at all, are far too generalized and do not really offer one
                    the opportunity to better their game on an individual and focused level, but
                    rather just tell if they have been doing reasonably well or not (which they could tell from the
                    general outcome of their games mind you). Thus our visualization is aimed at any players looking to
                    find any individual statistics for their games, the roles they played in the games (top lane, mid
                    lane, jungle or bottom lane) as well as the areas on the map and the times certain key events are
                    happening to them, on average or on an individual game basis. These statistics, as stated earlier
                    could be used to get better at the game, for interest sake, or just to brag to your friends.

                <h4 style="margin-top: 30px;margin-bottom:-10px;">What We Want To Do</h4>

                <p><br/> We want to make a visualization that enables competitive players to analyze how they are
                    performing
                    relative to the map. Being able to visualize where you are getting kills and where you are dying can
                    help improve your play style and as a result improve your chances of winning.<br/><br/>Using the
                    data provided by the Riot API (match history, player data, player events, etc.) we can also create
                    overlays that can help optimize how you play your
                    role. Points can be generated to show where the player spends the majority of their time, how
                    efficiently they are killing minions in the jungle and what route they decided to take to clear
                    these camps. Scatter plots can help to visualise the displacement of kills and deaths for any given
                    player and give them valuable insight into their play styles.<br/><br/>As League of Legends is an
                    objective based game, our visualization will show which events took place leading up to the
                    objective, this will give insight into why you successfully took any particular objective or failed
                    to do so.<br/><br>Through the use of our visualisations, we hope to help players getter a better
                    idea of how they play the game and what steps they can take to become better players</br>
                </p>
                <h4 style="margin-top: 30px;margin-bottom:-10px;">Related Work</h4>

                <p><br/>
                    <a href="http://www.lolking.net">LoLKing.net</a> is one of the most widely used information bases
                    for any league based statistics, news
                    and champion information<sup><a href="#puller">[1]</a></sup>, in general LoLKing is the go to place
                    for anything League. That being said, their mass of visual statistics are in the forms of charts
                    and graphs, as well as being more focused on teams rather than players. Their match history does not
                    provide any map based visualization, firstly, and secondly no medium to compare performance based on
                    Role or individual match.<br/><br/>
                    Below you can see an example of their individual statistics and just how general it is. That being
                    said, their use of colour is a good way of showing an increase or decrease in personal LoLking score
                    (a general metric of how well or bad you are playing presently) or your match history.<sup>
                        <a href="#puller1">[2]</a></sup>
                </p>
                <a href="static/images/lolking_main.jpg" data-lightbox="lolking_main.jpg">
                    <img class="responsive-img" style="width:100%;" src="static/images/lolking_main.jpg">
                </a>

                <p><br/>
                    Another example we found was that of a visualization of the movement of players (random players) on
                    the map for 10 000 games, whilst this shows something on the map and would be interesting for a
                    player to see, it provides no meaningful statistics to an individual and shows too little
                    information. Here is what it looks like, for interest sake:<sup><a href="#puller2">[3]</a></sup>
                </p>
                <video id="vid1" width="640" height="480" controls preload>
                    <source src="http://int.nyt.com/data/videotape/finished/2014/10/09/lolstats/lane-b-4-470.mp4"
                            type="video/mp4"></source>
                </video>
                <p><br/>
                    The next example shows something closer to what we were looking for. The heatmap shows regions where
                    player deaths (when they are defeated by an opponent) occurred on the map and the amount (darker
                    red) of deaths, as well as the time-span for these amounts<sup><a href="#puller3">[4]</a></sup>.
                    While being closer to what we
                    envisioned, the graphic still had no individual value, you may be able to see where you are likely
                    to die, but not where you as an individual had been dying or what role you were playing. That
                    coupled with the fact that the heatmap isn’t easy to read on the background (poor colour
                    choice) and that it is in no way dynamic or interactive lead us to believe that this kind of
                    visualisation could be done better.

                </a>

                <p>
                    So as you can see from the above examples something
                    personal and graphic, as to the locations on the map where events had occurred for that player was
                    required.

                <div class="divider"></div>
                <p><br/>
                    The following visual queries are what we believe our visualisation support and allow users to make.
                </p>
                <h4 style="margin-top: 30px;margin-bottom:-10px;">Interface</h4>

                <p><br/>
                <li>How many kills, deaths and assists were I involved in this game (or a group of selected games)?</li>
                <p style="padding-left: 3em;">The amount of kills deaths and assists you get and where these events
                    occur is the most important visual query as it is the direct indicator as to how well you are doing
                    and in what areas these good or bad plays are happening. Addressing areas where you die a lot is an
                    easy way to get better quickly.</p>
                <li>What are my amount of kills and death for a particular game?</li>
                <li>How much income do I make per game and how many creeps do I kill?</li>
                <br/>
                The interface does well to answer these questions and using visual cues it helps guide the users
                eyes to the appropriate section of information, through the use of colours and offsets in the interface
                representation.
                </p>
                <h4 style="margin-top: 30px;margin-bottom:-10px;">Map</h4>

                <p><br/>
                <li>Where did the kills events occur on the map during a specific match and at what times?</li>
                <li>Where am I dying or killing most champions when I am playing a specific role.</li>
                <li>What objectives (such as Dragon and Baron kills, etc. and at what times)?</li>
                <li>How much times am I spending in which parts of the map?</li>
                <br/>


                <u>Kills/deaths/assists:</u><br/>
                The amount of kills deaths and assists you get and where these events occur is the most important visual
                query as it is the direct indicator as to how well you are doing and in what areas these good or bad
                plays are happening. Addressing areas where you die a lot is an easy way to get better
                quickly.<br/><br/>
                <u>Objectives (Baron and Dragon):</u><br/> Knowing at what times these objectives are taken and by whom
                as well as the activity around the area of these objectives is extremely important as the buffs these
                monsters provide your team are key to victory and people tend to fight stupidly around these areas,
                addressing these silly fights and poor execution is a good call for any league player. The most
                important thing would be to know if you are doing well in the fights around the objectives or poorly
                (which can be shown by kills/deaths/assists around the pits)<br/><br/>
                It is important to know where you are spending majority of your time on the map during a specific role,
                for example, if you are playing Jungle you may be ganking (trying to help your team) too much or too
                little and knowing these times spent in the areas of the map can really help your jungle clear times and
                overall play in the jungle. This is just one example from one role as to the importance of knowing where
                you spend your time.<br/><br/>
                Gold is used to purchase items which make your champion stronger and itemizing properly is a key part to
                victory, one incorrect item choice can be the difference between a win and a loss, as such it is
                extremely important to know how much money you are making and how much of that money is coming through
                farming (creep kills).
                <br/><br/>
                The map is the true form of the visualisation. It displays information of the matches dynamically by
                generating points to plot on the fly when a user clicks on the desired matches from the interface. The
                map uses an array of shapes with different colours to distinguish between key events in the matches.
                This allows a user to quickly and easily identify the respective event. We believe that the map is very
                effective at visualising the data that a player would want to see about his/her own matches.

                <h1>Design Iterations</h1>

                <div class="divider"></div>
                <p>
                    Our design followed a procedure of 3 iterations, involving refinement over each iteration. We
                    had an extremely general principal to work with. We knew that we wanted a application to display the
                    relevant statistics (kills, deaths, assists, ward placements and kills) and a map to display where
                    they occurred. <b>(Click the picture headings to display/hide them. They have icons next to
                    them.)</b>
                </p>
                <br/>
                <h4>First Design</h4>

                <p><br/>
                    The initial design was a very rough mock-up of the interface that we wanted to use to display the
                    concept in order to decide whether it was worth going forward. The basic layout was decided here and
                    this was kept throughout all the designs. The box on the left displays the list of player match
                    history in separate boxes with a summary of their statistics for each respective game displayed in
                    the boxes. The summary would be the most important information that a player needs to see about
                    each match. These include:
                </p>
                <li>
                    Player Kills
                </li>
                <li>
                    Player Deaths
                </li>
                <li>
                    Gold Per Minute
                </li>
                <li>
                    Player Assists
                </li>
                <p>
                    The map on the left is used to show the kills and deaths of players based on the specific matches
                    which
                    data they would want to see of. This is added to the map when a box is clicked once and removed when
                    the
                    clicked box is clicked again. The map features a time slider that would allow events during specific
                    times to be shows, for closer inspection.<br/><br/>Various checkboxes will allow matches that are
                    displayed to be filtered by specific requirements.

                <h4>Second Design</h4>

                <p>
                    We started getting really excited about our design and though about what we could do to assist
                    visual queries. Firstly, we added a most obvious feature which would be to search for a player to
                    get that player's data. The design for this page was simple and the combination of the colours and
                    text allow aid in helping people easily understand how to use it.
                </p>
                <ul class="collapsible collapsible-accordion">
                    <li>
                        <div class="collapsible-header"><i class="mdi-action-search"></i>Search Screen</div>
                        <div class="collapsible-body"><a href="static/images/second_search.png"
                                                         data-lightbox="second_search.png"><img style="width:100%;"
                                                                                                src="static/images/second_search.png"></a>
                        </div>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p><br/>
                    The main interface was given a major overhaul. Since this is the screen with the most information,
                    we needed to use good practices to allow people to easily satisfy visual queries. Each box on the
                    right represents an individual match, as mentioned before. For the status of a won or lost game, a
                    differentiation of typical green and red colours for each respective box is used. The player
                    champion icon is displayed to allow players to better remember prior matches and information was
                    laid out in a cleaner, better way.<br/><br/>The biggest change was the introduction of texture to
                    allow differentiation of matches that are selected and that are currently supplying information to
                    the map or not. When the box is selected, a diagonal texture is used to distinguish it.
                </p>

                    <li>

                                                                                              src="static/images/second_main.png"></a>
                        </div>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><br/>
                    The idea of the focused map is improved on the second iterations and here we decided to add
                    filtering rules to the map, as well as move the time slider from the main interface to here. It
                    makes more sense to have the time slider in the setting that is larger, where more information can
                    be seen and understood.<br/><br/>Filters were also added, giving additional flexibility to have more
                    match specific features or events turned on or off, as opposed to just having the match history
                    affected. During this design phase we found that the API Riot provides developers in order to access
                    these statistics had some limitation in terms of the data that we could pull. We initially planned
                    on having ward placements and kills in the visualisation with specific timings, because they can
                    provide players with very insightful information, but unfortunately the geo-data on these are not
                    provided as we had originally believed.

                <p>
                    We received a lot of positive criticism on this design when we presented it to our class for
                    evaluation.
                    Some of the suggested changed seemed to have less to do with the visualisation and more to do with
                    adding additional features. Video games are a popular topic. :D
                    <br/><br/>
                    We did get useful feedback on the visual aspects, though. This included the ability to add more than
                    one
                    player to compare, the making items appear in the timeline, toggling between multiple selected games
                    and
                    a single one, using non-distracting texture and colour on the map, etc. These were well considered
                    and
                    implemented for the final design.
                    <br/><br/>

                <h4>Third Design</h4>

                <p>
                    This design stage actually went through many fine changes and decisions as we decided to add and
                    remove things where we felt it necessary.<br/><br/>The search interface had a big change. We
                    redesigned it to be more welcoming to players of League of Legends and also fixed one big flaw that
                    we had forgotten about: choosing which region a player plays in. We made some usability changes like
                    preventing a player from submitting a blank name and also animating the search button to indicate
                    that the application is polling the API and generating the statistics.
                </p>

                        <div class="collapsible-body"><a href="static/images/third_search.JPG"
                                                         data-lightbox="third_search.JPG"><img style="width:100%;"
                                                                                               src="static/images/third_search.JPG"></a>

                </ul>
                <p><br/>
                    We took the critique from our peers seriously and decided to redraw the map provided by Riot for use
                    with their API<sup><a href="#puller4">[5]</a></sup> (the design 2 map). Tracing it from scratch and
                    using scalable vector graphics, this not only allowed us to dull the colours and make it much more
                    appropriate for placing images on top of it, but also for resizing it without quality loss. We
                    utilized
                    colour shifts and texture to indicate water, jungle and etc.
                </p>

                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><br/>
                    Our final implementation of the map, populated with the user data utilizes a scatter plot like
                    approach across the map instead of a heatmap, for more readability. We believe that this combined
                    with the colour code as well as shapes to represent the different fields, marked by the key at the
                    top provides the user with the clearest version of the data they are seeking (from this they can
                    easily query where they are dying the most, killing the most etc). Textures and colours are also
                    used to indicate the “Jungle” region as well as the “River” and are done so in such a manner as to
                    not occlude any data or overly clutter the map in any way. If you hover above the individual points
                    more detailed information about the event is available such as the time the event occurred and the
                    exact coordinate of the event. We chose a dark blue for kills as it can be seen as a positive colour
                    (a lime green was an option but didn’t read well in the jungle regions) and bright red for the
                    deaths as it appeared most negative and would invoke the sense of a bad occurrence off the bat. A
                    fuscia colour being chosen for assists came as it was a sort of intermediary colour, whilst being
                    positive is still not as advantageous as kills. Even at high volumes of data, we believe this
                    implementation holds its value and provides the user with meaningful data.

                <p>
                    Firstly we believe that our visualization provides the user with a lot of information regarding
                    their individual play and how the play with each role, where they are doing well, or poorly and
                    helps overall to better their game. Secondly with the ability to compare to their other roles and
                    other people they can really get down to what they should be doing with what role. With our
                    visualization we believe that the user can get a real feel for their match history rather than
                    seeing what they already know from the post game statistics (kills, deaths etc) by putting into
                    context of the map itself as well as putting it into context with other players. The one weakness is
                    that with large amounts of data the map becomes cluttered and occlusion can occur and we needed to
                    find a way around this.<br/><br/> As far as difficulties during the project, we found that pulling
                    data from the API was extremely effective but we needed to sift through the data and decode it quite
                    a bit before it became useful and this took some time and effort. This combined with finding a way
                    to effectively display this large quantity of data in a small area whilst maintaining as much
                    meaning as possible was quite the challenge.<br/><br/>So we decided that with checkboxes which could
                    turn data on and off and only displaying the data for the specified time we could minimize noise on
                    the map and give the user the data they wanted to see. Coupled with a good colour scheme for the
                    points we believe our visualization overcome the clutter
                    and provide a meaningful portrayal of the data.

                    We believe that through our efforts after receiving feedback on the second iteration we have
                    addressed
                    most of the key points that have been brought up about the various aspects of the application. The
                    design has benefited tremendously.<br/><br/> As much as we
                    believe that our visualization has a lot of potential to be a meaningful source of information and
                    statistics for all players looking to get better at the game or just see how they are doing in
                    general, there is always room for improvement. In the future a potential switch to a heat map type
                    structure for heavily cluttered map could provide promising results. We also believe there is a
                    place for this visualization on a forum such as LoLKing or somewhere of the sort considering that
                    we, as avid League players see a definite benefit from a Visualization such as this.
